    most rigid and exacting kitchens. A year in New York, with the three Michelin
    starred team at the world-renowned Eleven Madison Park, ignited a desire to travel.
    Stephen was drawn to Australia and to Melbourne's exciting dining scene, where
    the city's culinary institutions welcomed him. As Executive Chef leading the kitchen
    and events at Vue de Monde, his reputation grew. Stephen continued his journey
    at Estelle by Scott Pickett and then by helping to establish Matilda. Since 2018
    Stephen has been Culinary Director at Capitol Grand. His understanding of the
    produce and flavours of Australia enable him to create unmistakable menus that
    showcase his unique skills and craftsmanship not only in our restaurants, but
