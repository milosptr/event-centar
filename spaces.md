  spaces can be transformed to offer a spectacular setting for any occasion. \n\nThe
  venue’s breathtaking decor features striking light fixtures and walls dripping with
  the original art pieces of David Bromley. An oversized service bar demands your
  attention (and favourite cocktail order) while a window peering into the kitchen
  allows for a ringside seat to ignite your senses as you witness culinary masters
  at work. Vast floor to ceiling windows are a magnet for natural light and invite
  uninterrupted views of the world outside to dazzle your guests.\n\nChoose from four
  incredible spaces to enjoy, independently or connected, for one seamless event.
  Our creative team will work with you to plan and execute an event as unique and
  memorable as you. \n\n"
